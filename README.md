# System Software And Microprocessors Lab Programs

This repository contains implementations of core algorithms covered in the **System Software and Microprocessors Laboratory**.  

The lab is divided into two sections:
- **System Software Section** (to be added)  
- **Microprocessors Section** (contents given below)

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment 1 â€“ CPU Scheduling Algorithms
1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**  
   - Processes are executed in the order they arrive.  
2. **Priority Scheduling**  
   - Each process is assigned a priority; CPU is allocated to the highest priority process.  
3. **Round Robin (RR)**  
   - Each process gets the CPU in fixed time slices (time quantum).  
4. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**  
   - The process with the smallest burst time is executed first.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment 2 â€“ Page Replacement Algorithms
1. **FIFO (First In First Out)**  
   - The page that entered memory first is replaced first.  
2. **LRU (Least Recently Used)**  
   - The page that has not been used for the longest time is replaced.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment 3 â€“ Disk Scheduling Algorithms
1. **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**  
   - Requests are served in the order they arrive.  
2. **SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)**  
   - The disk arm moves like an elevator: servicing requests in one direction, then reversing.  
3. **C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)**  
   - Similar to SCAN, but only services in one direction and jumps back to the beginning.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment 4 â€“ Bankerâ€™s Algorithm
- **Bankerâ€™s Algorithm**  
   - A resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that checks for a safe sequence of processes.

### ðŸ”¹ Experiment 5 â€“ Memory Management Techniques
1. **First Fit**  
   - Allocates the first free block that is large enough for the process.  
2. **Worst Fit**  
   - Allocates the largest free block available, leaving the largest leftover space.  
3. **Best Fit**  
   - Allocates the smallest free block that is large enough, leaving the least leftover space.
